# Fine dust cleaning project for Seoul
---
The BSS project is developing an open-source software for data analysis aimed at reducing fine dust levels in Seoul.

Currently, the government of the republic of korea is implementing various policies to reduce fine dust.

1. Strict regulations on industrial emissions are in effect.
2. Cooperation with neighboring countries has been concluded to reduce air pollutants.
3. Recommendations to restrict people from going out are implemented during periods when fine dust concentrations are high.

However, there is still no clear policy to reduce fine dust generated within the city, which is close to the spaces where citizens live. 
Therefore, our project, BluSkySeoul, would like to propose ideas to reduce fine dust in the city, starting from Seoul.

Main Goal: First, using data related to city buses, we identify areas with high pedestrian traffic to determine locations for the installation of outdoor fine dust reduction devices. Second, based on areas with high pedestrian traffic, we establish routes for street cleaning vehicles to ensure that fine dust reduction is noticeable to the citizens.

All codes and Datas were uploaded on our Github.
