# Fine dust cleaning project for Seoul
---

Main Goal: First, using data related to city buses, we identify areas with high pedestrian traffic to determine locations for the installation of outdoor fine dust reduction devices. Second, based on areas with high pedestrian traffic, we establish routes for street cleaning vehicles to ensure that fine dust reduction is noticeable to the citizens.

All codes and Datas were uploaded on our Github.
