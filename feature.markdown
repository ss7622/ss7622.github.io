# Main features of BlueSkySeoul

1. You can check coordinate of Seoul by visualization tool, [follium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium)

2. You can check the location of bus stops with a high floating population in Seoul by analyzing bus data.

3. You can check the fine dust concentration of spring in each district of Seoul by analyzing daily air pollution level.

# Main idea

1. Install street-lamp type fine dust reduction devices in the district where fine dust concentration is high-level.

2. The more people, the more fine dust. So install fine dust reduction devices at the top 10 bus stops, ranked by number of people getting on and off.
